  "The display model -> hiccup, in a class vocabulary the consuming surface
  styles itself.

  ## Why this emits no design-system components

  The two surfaces this exists for are on different design systems.
  `network-awai/cloud-itonami`'s cockpit is on the kotoba-ui paved road
  (`kotoba-ui.core` + `appkit.core`, HIG tokens); `cloud-itonami-app` depends
  on `jp-go-digital-design-system` directly. A component here that called
  either one would force the other surface off its own paved road, and a
  component that abstracted over both would be a third design system nobody
  asked for.

  So this namespace emits plain elements carrying a documented class and
  `data-*` vocabulary, and each surface owns the CSS. That is not a
  compromise invented here — the cockpit's own hydration script already
  injects `.row` / `.pill` / `.business-card` markup for exactly the dense
  rows that 'can't be shell components', so this fits the pattern already in
  place there.

  ## The vocabulary

    .yakuwari-fleet                    root
      .yakuwari-fleet-totals           one .yakuwari-metric per figure
      .yakuwari-group                  one per business
        .yakuwari-group-head
          .yakuwari-group-name / -domain
        .yakuwari-role[data-health]    one per role; data-health is the hook
          .yakuwari-role-head
            .yakuwari-role-id
            .yakuwari-role-badge       present only when outward
          .yakuwari-role-objective
          .yakuwari-capacity           .yakuwari-pill[data-kind]
          .yakuwari-needs-human        .yakuwari-cap[data-decision]
          .yakuwari-role-problems      present only when invalid
      .yakuwari-orphans                present only when non-empty
      .yakuwari-empty                  present only when a group has no roles

  `data-health` and `data-decision` carry state instead of a class per state,
  so a surface writes one selector per value rather than one class per
  combination, and an unrecognised value still renders (unstyled) rather than
  disappearing.

  Values are emitted verbatim as strings. Nothing here escapes anything —
  hiccup renderers do that, and doing it twice double-escapes."
